## 25.04.0 - 2025-04-04
### Added
* Add helper for streaming a file with a correctly encoded content disposition header to allow utf-8 filenames
* Add setup for collecting and exposing prometheus metrics with custom metrics and sqlstats metrics.
* Add custom not found handler for echo to show a HTML page if text/html is requested
* Add endpoint to delete user account with all related data
### Changed
* Moved the data fixtures from `internal/data/` to a separate package in `internal/data/fixtures`. **BREAKING**: Existing changes to the fixtures need to be moved from `internal/data/` to `internal/data/fixtures` and imports need to be updated
* Move the application logic from the handlers to dedicated services. **BREAKING**: This might break existing applications that have custom changes to the handlers. The custom changes need to be reflected in the new services.
* Fix the naming of the put push token endpoint from post to put
* Moved the auth related parts from `internal/api/auth` to `internal/auth`. **BREAKING**: Changes to `authentication_result.go`, `context.go` and `scopes.go` need to be reflected in `internal/auth` instead of `internal/api/auth` and imports need to be updated
* Bump Postgres from `postgres:12.4-alpine` to `postgres:17.4-alpine`. See the official Postgres release notes for more details:

* Move the test fixtures from `internal/test/` to a separate package in `internal/test/fixtures`. **BREAKING**: Existing changes to the fixtures need to be moved from `internal/test/` to `internal/test/fixtures` and imports need to be updated
