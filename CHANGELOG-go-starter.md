## 25.04.0 - 2025-04-04
### Added
* Add helper for streaming a file with a correctly encoded content disposition header to allow utf-8 filenames
* Add setup for collecting and exposing prometheus metrics with custom metrics and sqlstats metrics.
* Add custom not found handler for echo to show a HTML page if text/html is requested
* Add endpoint to delete user account with all related data
### Changed
* Moved the data fixtures from `internal/data/` to a separate package in `internal/data/fixtures`. **BREAKING**: Existing changes to the fixtures need to be moved from `internal/data/` to `internal/data/fixtures` and imports need to be updated
* Move the application logic from the handlers to dedicated services. **BREAKING**: This might break existing applications that have custom changes to the handlers. The custom changes need to be reflected in the new services.
* Fix the naming of the put push token endpoint from post to put
* Moved the auth related parts from `internal/api/auth` to `internal/auth`. **BREAKING**: Changes to `authentication_result.go`, `context.go` and `scopes.go` need to be reflected in `internal/auth` instead of `internal/api/auth` and imports need to be updated
* Bump Postgres from `postgres:12.4-alpine` to `postgres:17.4-alpine`. See the official Postgres release notes for more details:
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/13.0/
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.0/

  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.0/

* Move the test fixtures from `internal/test/` to a separate package in `internal/test/fixtures`. **BREAKING**: Existing changes to the fixtures need to be moved from `internal/test/` to `internal/test/fixtures` and imports need to be updated

### Deprecated
* Deprecated the mailer option UseTLS (`SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS`) in favour of Encryption (`SERVER_SMTP_ENCRYPTION`). If you were using the `SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS` flag before to enable TLS, you will need to migrate to the `SERVER_SMTP_ENCRYPTION` setting of `tls`. For the moment, both settings are supported (with a warning being printed when using `SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS`, however support for the deprecated config will be dropped in one of the next releases. See [Mailer UseTLS SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS Deprecation](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/Mailer-UseTLS-SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS-Deprecation)
### Removed

### Changed
* Refactor migration application logic to apply each missing migration individually and to print infos about the migration being applied
* Refactor the cobra cmd setup structure and the flag parsing logic using struct-based flags.
**BREAKING**: The restructuring breaks additionally created subcommands attached to the existing commands. See [Migration Guide Command Restructuring](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/Migration-Guide-Command-Restructuring)

## 2024-06-11
- Update to [golang:1.22.4-bookworm](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/golang/1.22.4-bookworm/images/sha256-5eb6d52cd78951fa53884e208a030db506ab619a13157b9b7ea3a8eb5e4cbeee?context=explore) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`) containing the bump from Debian `bullseye`(11) to `bookworm` (12)
  - Minor: [Bump github.com/golangci/golangci-lint from 1.55.2 to 1.59.0](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases/tag/v1.59.0)
  - Minor: [Bump github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum from 1.11.0 to 1.12.0](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/releases/tag/v1.12.0)
- Extended and fixed the password reset handling by a debounce and reuse duration. This can for example be leveraged to mitigate email flooding. The token reuse fixes an existing solution that was not working due to searching for tokens created on minute in the future instead of the past using `models.PasswordResetTokenWhere.CreatedAt.GT(time.Now().Add(time.Minute*1)),`. The new default behaviour is to debounce the password reset by 60 seconds and not to reuse reset tokens: 
  - `PasswordResetTokenDebounceDuration` / `SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_DEBOUNCE_DURATION_SECONDS`: if a password reset token has been created in this duration, no password reset is initialized (default: 60 seconds)
  - `PasswordResetTokenReuseDuration` / `SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_REUSE_DURATION_SECONDS`: if a password reset token has been created in this duration and is still valid, it is reused instead of re-created (default-value: 0 seconds->no reuse)
- Added test helper to simplify assertion of `httperrors.HTTPError` verifying the http status code and the returned error, example usage:
```go
res := test.PerformRequest(t, s, "POST", "/api/v1/auth/forgot-password/complete", payload, nil)
response := test.RequireHTTPError(t, res, httperrors.ErrNotFoundTokenNotFound)
```
- Added helpers to get last sent emails from mock transport using `mail := test.GetLastSentMail(t, s.Mailer)` or `sentMails := test.GetSentMails(t, s.Mailer)`
- Bumped Github Actions `github/codeql-action` from v1 to v3 and set go version in `go.mod` to `1.22.4` due to https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/15647

## 2024-05-28
- Fixes the `LogErrorFuncWithRequestInfo` to return the error in order to pass the error to the global error handling mechanism

## 2024-05-14
- Switch [from Go 1.21.6 Go 1.21.10](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.21.0) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Extended the snapshot and request helper to improve the test experience when snapshotting raw JSON (`.SaveJSON`) and raw bytes like images (`.SaveBytes`)
- Improved custom replace function in snapshot helper to only redact explicit matches
- Added custom LogErrorFunc for recover middleware to attach request info the recover log messages
- Adjusted order of validation error matching to correctly return list of errors wrapped in single error
- Added vulnerability scanning to dev container (trivy and govulncheck)

## 2024-02-01
- [Persist bash history in development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/persist-bash-history) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
  - Your commands are now persisted between your development container restarts / rebuilds, making it easier to re-run specific commands you've previously executed (e.g. that one go command you cannot remember).
- Hotfix [types.NullDecimal error](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/issues/1234) by  downgrading indirect `github.com/ericlagergren/decimal@v0.0.0-20190420051523-6335edbaa640`.
  - Note that we do not pin it in direct dependencies, as this downgrade is already in [SQLBoilers master](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/commit/bc59c158590800f7810cce241a12d572e898014f) anyways.

- Improve speed of `make swagger` when dealing with many files in `/api` by generating to a docker volume instead of the host filesystem, rsyncing only to changes into `/internal/types`. Furthermore split our swagger type generation and validation into two separate make targets, that can run concurrently (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
  - Note that `/app/api/tmp`, `/app/tmp` and `/app/bin` are now baked by proper docker volumes when using our `docker-compose.yml`/`./docker-helper.sh --up`. You **cannot** remove these directories directly inside the container (but its contents) and you can also no longer see its files on your host machine directly!
- Fix `make check-gen-dirs` false positives hidden files.
- Allow to trace/benchmark `Makefile` targets execution by using a custom shell wrapper for make execution. See `SHELL` and `.SHELLFLAGS` within `Makefile` and the custom `rksh` script in the root working directory. Usage: `MAKE_TRACE_TIME=true make <target>`
- `go.mod` changes:

## 2022-09-13
- Hotfix: Previously there was a chance of recursive error wrapping within our [`internal/api/router/error_handler.go`](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/blob/master/internal/api/router/error_handler.go) in combination with `*echo.HTTPError`. We currently disable this wrapping (as not used anyways) and will schedule a cleaner update regarding this error augmentation approach.

## 2022-04-15
- Switch [from Go 1.17.1 to Go 1.17.9](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.17.minor) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- **BREAKING** Add [`tenv`](https://github.com/sivchari/tenv) and [`errorlint`](https://github.com/polyfloyd/go-errorlint) linter to our default `.golangci.yml` configuration.
  - We switch from `os.Setenv` to [`t.Setenv`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Setenv) within our own test code.
  - **NOTE**: If you have used `os.Setenv` within your `*_test.go` code previously, simply replace those calls by `t.Setenv`.
  - **NOTE**: The go-starter base code now properly uses `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for comparisons (and `%w` wrapping where really needed). For a good overview regarding error handling see [Effective Error Handling in Golang](https://earthly.dev/blog/golang-errors/). For example, if you receive linting errors, you'll need to change your code like this:
    - Wrong: `if err == sql.ErrNoRows {`
      - Valid: `if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {`
    - Wrong: `if err != sql.ErrConnDone {`
      - Valid:  `if !errors.Is(err, sql.ErrConnDone) {`
    - Wrong: `gErr := err.(*googleapi.Error)`, Valid:
      - `var gErr *googleapi.Error`
      - `ok := errors.As(err, &gErr)`
- `Dockerfile` development stage changes (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`):
  - Bump [golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) base image from `golang:1.17.1-buster` to **`golang:1.17.8-buster`**.
  - Bump [pgFormatter](https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter) from v5.0 to [v5.2](https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter/releases/tag/v5.2)
  - Bump [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) from v1.42.1 to [v1.45.2](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1452)
  - Bump [lichen](https://github.com/uw-labs/lichen) from v0.1.4 to [v0.1.5](https://github.com/uw-labs/lichen/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5)
  - Bump [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) from v1.17.0 to [v1.18.11](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/releases/tag/cli-v1.18.11) (+ switch from gnu to musl)
  - Bump [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) from v4.16.2 to [v4.24.2](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/v4.24.2)
  - Bump [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum) from v1.7.0 to [v1.8.0](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
  - Adds [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (debian apt managed)
- `go.mod` changes:
  - Major: [Bump `github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate` from v0.0.0-20210614095031-55d5740dbbcc to v1.1.1](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate/compare/55d5740dbbccbaa4934009263b37ba52d837241f...v1.1.1) (though this should not lead to any major changes)
  - Minor: [Bump github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/v4 from 4.6.0 to v4.9.2](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/blob/v4.9.2/CHANGELOG.md#v492---2022-04-11) (your generated model might slightly change, minor changes).
    - Note that v5 will prefer wrapping errors (e.g. `sql.ErrNoRows`) to retain the stack trace, thus it's about time for us to start to enforce proper `errors.Is` checks in our codebase (see above).
  - Minor: [#178: Bump github.com/labstack/echo/v4 from 4.6.1 to 4.7.2](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/178) (support for HEAD method query params binding, minor changes).
  - Minor: [#160: Bump github.com/rs/zerolog from 1.25.0 to 1.26.1](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/160) (minor changes).
  - Minor: [#179: Bump github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n/v2 from 2.1.2 to 2.2.0](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/179) (minor changes).
  - Minor: [Bump `github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype` from v1.3.1 to v1.4.0](https://github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype/releases/tag/v1.4.0)
  - Minor: [Bump `github.com/go-openapi/runtime` from v0.22.0 to v0.23.3](https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.3)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/go-openapi/strfmt` from v0.21.1 to v0.21.2](https://github.com/go-openapi/strfmt/compare/v0.21.1...v0.21.2)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/go-openapi/validate` from v0.20.3 to v0.21.0](https://github.com/go-openapi/validate/compare/v0.20.3...v0.21.0)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/lib/pq` from v1.10.3 to v1.10.5](https://github.com/lib/pq/compare/v1.10.3...v1.10.5)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal` from v1.8.0 to v1.8.1](https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/releases/tag/v1.8.1)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/stretchr/testify` from v1.7.0 to v1.7.1](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/compare/v1.7.0...v1.7.1)
  - Patch: [Bump `github.com/volatiletech/strmangle` from v0.0.1 to v0.0.2](https://github.com/volatiletech/strmangle/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2)
  - Minor: [Bump `google.golang.org/api` from v0.63.0 to v0.74.0](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client/compare/v0.63.0...v0.74.0)
  - Minor: [Bump `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
  - Bump `golang.org/x/crypto` from v0.0.0-20211215165025-cf75a172585e to v0.0.0-20220411220226-7b82a4e95df4
  - Bump `golang.org/x/sys` from v0.0.0-20211210111614-af8b64212486 to v0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad
- We now support overriding `ENV` variables during **local** development through a `.env.local` dotenv file.
  - This does not require a development container restart.
  - We override the env within the app process through `config.DefaultServiceConfigFromEnv()`, so this does not mess with the actual container ENV.
  - See `.env.local.sample` for further instructions to use this.
  - Note that `.env.local` is **NEVER automatically** applied during **test runs**. If you really need that, use the specialized `test.DotEnvLoadLocalOrSkipTest` helper before loading up your server within that very test! This ensures that this test is automatically skipped if the `.env.local` file is no longer available.
- VSCode windows closes now explicitly stop Docker containers via [`shutdownAction: "stopCompose"`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) within `.devcontainer.json`.
  - Use `./docker-helper --halt` or other `docker` or `docker-compose` management commands to do this explicitly instead.
- Drone CI specific (minor): Fix multiline ENV variables were messing up our `.hostenv` for `docker run` command testing of the final image.

## 2022-03-28

- Merged [#165: Allow use of db.join* methods more than once](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/165), thx [danut007ro](https://github.com/danut007ro).
- Merged [#169: Switch to standalone cobra-cli dependency](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/169), thx [liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
  - [`github.com/spf13/cobra@v1.4.0`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases/tag/v1.4.0) split into `cobra` (the lib) and [`github.com/spf13/cobra-cli`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/releases) (the generator / scaffolding tool)
  - We'll now depend on `cobra-cli` directly in our `Dockerfile`, while the core `cobra` dependency stays unchanged within our `go.mod`.
  - Bumps [`github.com/spf13/cobra`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) from v1.3.0 to [v1.4.0](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases/tag/v1.4.0)
- Fixed `test.ApplyMigrations` when combined with the import SQL dump mechanics in the testing context.
  - Previously, we did still use the default [sql-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate) `gorp_migrations` table to track applied migrations in our test databases, not our typical `migrations` table used everywhere else.
  - This especially lead to problems when importing (production / live) SQL dumps via `test.WithTestDatabaseFromDump*`, `test.WithTestServerFromDump*` or `test.WithTestServerConfigurableFromDump` as our implementation tried to apply **all migrations** every time, regardless if a partial migration set was already applied previously (as the already applied migrations were not tracked within the `migrations` table (but within `gorp_migrations`) we did not notice).
  - We now initialize this pipeline correctly in the test context (similar to our usage within `cmd/db_migrate.go` or `app db migrate`) and explicitly set these globals through `config.DatabaseMigrationTable` and `config.DatabaseMigrationFolder`.
  - If you encounter problems after the upgrade, please execute `make sql-drop-all` in your local environment to reset the IntegreSQL test databases, then run `make sql-reset && make sql-spec-reset && make sql-spec-migrate && make all` to rebuild and test.


## 2022-02-28

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Username format change in auth handlers
  - Added the `util.ToUsernameFormat` helper function, which will **lowercase** and **trim whitespaces**. We use it to format usernames in the login, register, and forgot-password handlers.
    - This prevents user duplication (e.g. two accounts registered with the same email address with different casing) and
    - cases where users would inadvertently register with specific casing or a trailing whitespace after their username, and subsequently struggle to log into their account.
  - **This effectively locks existing users whose username contains uppercase characters and/or whitespaces out of their accounts.**
    - Before rolling out this change, check whether any existing users are affected and migrate their usernames to a format that is compatible with this change.
    - Be aware that this may cause conflicts in regard to the uniqueness constraint of usernames and therefore need to be resolved manually, which is why we are not including a database migration to automatically migrate existing usernames to the new format.
  - For more information and a possible manual database migration flow please see this special WIKI page: https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/2022-02-28

## 2022-02-03

### Changed

- Changed order of make targets in the `make swagger` pipeline. `make swagger-lint-ref-siblings` will now run after `make swagger-concat`, always linting the current version of our swagger file. This helps avoid errors regarding an invalid `swagger.yml` when resolving merge conflicts as those are often resolved by running `make swagger` and generating a fresh `swagger.yml`.

## 2022-02-02

### Changed

- Upgrades to [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) from to v0.26.1 to [v0.29.0](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/tag/v0.29.0) (development stage only, requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`). Includes the following `go.mod` upgrades:
  - [github.com/go-openapi/runtime](https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime) from v0.19.31 to v0.22.0
  - [github.com/go-openapi/strfmt](https://github.com/go-openapi/strfmt) from v0.20.2 to v0.21.1
  - [github.com/go-openapi/validate](https://github.com/go-openapi/validate) from v0.20.2 to v0.20.3
  - [github.com/go-openapi/errors](https://github.com/go-openapi/errors) from v0.20.1 to v0.20.2
  - [github.com/go-openapi/swag](https://github.com/go-openapi/swag) from v0.19.15 to v0.21.1
- Adds `yq` ([yq: a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)) to our `Dockerfile` (development stage only, requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Adds `make swagger-lint-ref-siblings` which is now executed as part of the `make build` (and `make swagger`) pipeline.
  - Any sibling elements of a Swagger `$ref` are ignored.
  - We have seen several misuses of `$ref` in our projects causing weird merge/flatten behaviors, thus we now lint for this case explicitly.
  - Having `$ref` and sibling elements (e.g. `required`, `example`, ...) is unsupported by [OpenAPI v2: $ref and Sibling Elements](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/) itself and the [JSON Reference specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) itself.
  - To mitigate these errors, either expand the referenced element (fully remove `$ref`) or create a new element including your custom siblings elements and `$ref` this new one.
- Fix schema visualization generation guide in `docs/schemacrawler/README.md`

## 2021-12-14

### Changed
- Add i18n service wrapping `go-i18n` package by nicksnyder.
  - Allows parsing of Accept-Language header and language string.
  - Support for templating using go templating language in message values.
  - Support for [CLDR plural keys](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules)
  - Added environment variables to configure i18n service
    - `SERVER_I18N_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` - set default language for i18n service
    - `SERVER_I18N_BUNDLE_DIR_ABS` - set directory of i81n messages, available languages are automatically configured by the files present in the folder

## 2021-11-29

### Changed

- The `integresql` service previously bound its port (`5000`) to the host machine. As this conflicts with newer macOS releases and is not necessary for the development workflow, the port is now only exposed to the linked services.

## 2021-10-22

### Changed

- Fixes minor `Makefile` typos.
- New go-starter releases are now git tagged (starting from the previous release `go-starter-2021-10-19` onwards). See [FAQ: What's the process of a new go-starter release?](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/FAQ#whats-the-process-of-a-new-go-starter-release)
- You may now specify a **specific** tag/branch/commit from the upstream [go-starter](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter) project while running `make git-fetch-go-starter`, `make git-compare-go-starter` and `make git-merge-go-starter`. This will especially come in handy if you want to do a multi-phased merge (for projects that haven't been updated in a long time):
  - Merge with the latest: `make git-merge-go-starter`
  - Merge with a specific tag, e.g. the tag [`go-starter-2021-10-19`](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/releases/tag/go-starter-2021-10-19): `GIT_GO_STARTER_TARGET=go-starter-2021-10-19 make git-merge-go-starter`
  - Merge with a specific branch, e.g. the branch [`mr/housekeeping`](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/tree/mr/housekeeping): `GIT_GO_STARTER_TARGET=go-starter/mr/housekeeping make git-merge-go-starter` (heads up! it's `go-starter/<branchname>`)
  - Merge with a specific commit, e.g. the commit [`e85bedb94c3562602bc23d2bfd09fca3b13d1e02`](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/commit/e85bedb94c3562602bc23d2bfd09fca3b13d1e02): `GIT_GO_STARTER_TARGET=e85bedb94c3562602bc23d2bfd09fca3b13d1e02 make git-merge-go-starter`
- The primary GitHub Action pipeline `.github/workflows/build-test.yml` has been synced to include most validation tasks from our internal `.drone.yml` pipeline. Furthermore:
  - Avoid `Build & Test` GitHub Action running twice (on `push` and on `pull_request`).
  - Add trivy scan to our base Build & Test pipeline (as we know also build and test the `app` target docker image).
  - Our GitHub Action pipeline will no longer attempt to cache the previously built Docker images by other pipelines, as extracting/restoring from cache (docker buildx) typically takes **longer** than fully rebuilding the whole image. We will reinvestigate caching mechanisms in the future if GitHub Actions provides a speedier and official integration for Docker images.

## 2021-10-19

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Upgrades to [Go 1.17.1](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17) `golang:1.17.1-buster`
  - Switch to `//go:build <tag>` from `// +build <tag>`.
  - Migrates `go.mod` via `go mod tidy -go=1.17` (pruned module graphs).
  - Do the following to upgrade:
    1. `make git-merge-go-starter`
    2. `./docker-helper --rebuild`
    3. Manually remove the new **second** `require` block (with all the `// indirect` modules) within your `go.mod`
    4. Execute `go mod tidy -go=1.17` once so the **second** `require` block appears again.
    5. Find `// +build <tag>` and replace it with `//go:build <tag>`.
    6. `make all`.
    7. Recheck your `go.mod` that the newly added `// indirect` transitive dependencies are the proper version as you were previously using (e.g. via the output from `make get-licenses` and `make get-embedded-modules`). Feel free to move any `// indirect` tagged dependencies in your **first** `require` block to the **second** block. This is where they should live.
- **BREAKING** You now need to take special care when it comes to parsing **semicolons** (`;`) in **query strings** via `net/url` and `net/http` from Go >1.17!
  - Anything before the semicolon will now be stripped. e.g. `example?a=1;b=2&c=3` would have returned `map[a:[1] b:[2] c:[3]]`, while now it returns `map[c:[3]]`
  - See [Go 1.17 URL query parsing](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17#semicolons).
  - You may need to manually migrate your handlers/tests regarding this new default handling.

## 2021-09-27

- **Hotfix**: We will pin the `Dockerfile` development and builder stage to `golang:1.16.7-buster` (+ `-buster`) for now, as currently the [new debian bullseye release within the go official docker images](https://github.com/docker-library/golang/commit/48a7371ed6055a97a10adb0b75756192ad5f1c97) breaks some tooling. The upgrade to debian bullseye and Go 1.17 will happen ~simultaneously~ **separately** within go-starter in the following weeks.

## 2021-08-16

### Changed

- remove ioutil (https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#ioutil)

## 2021-08-06

### Changed

- Bump golang from 1.16.6 to [1.16.7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.16.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Adds `util.GetEnvAsStringArrTrimmed` and minor `util` test coverage upgrades.

## 2021-08-04

### Changed

- `README.md` badges for go-starter.
- Fix some misspellings of English words within `internal/test/*.go` comments.
- Upgrades
  - Bump `github.com/labstack/echo/v4` from 4.4.0 to [4.5.0](https://github.com/labstack/echo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v450---2021-08-01):
    - Switch from `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` to [`github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) to mitigate [CVE-2020-26160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26160).
    - Note that it might take some time until the former dep fully leaves our dependency graph, as it is also a transitive dependency of various versions of [`github.com/spf13/viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/997).
    - However, even though this functionality was never used by go-starter, this change fixes an important part: The original `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` is no longer included in the **final `app` binary**, it is fully replaced by `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`.
    - Our `.trivyignore` still excludes [CVE-2020-26160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26160) as trivy cannot skip checking transitive dependencies.
    - **Breaking**: If you have actually directly depended upon `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go`, please switch to `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt` via the following command: `find -type f -name "*.go" -exec sed -i "s/dgrijalva\/jwt-go/golang-jwt\/jwt/g" {} \;`

## 2021-07-30

### Changed

- Upgrades:
  - Bump golang from 1.16.5 to [1.16.6](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/n9FxMelZGAQ)
  - Bump github.com/labstack/echo/v4 from 4.3.0 to [4.4.0](https://github.com/labstack/echo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (adds `binder.BindHeaders` support, not affecting our goswagger `runtime.Validatable` bind helpers)
  - Bump github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype from 1.3.0 to [1.3.1](https://github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
  - Bump github.com/spf13/cobra from 1.1.3 to [1.2.1](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases/tag/v1.2.1) (and see all the big completion upgrades in [1.2.0](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases/tag/v1.2.0))
  - Bump google.golang.org/api from 0.49.0 to [0.52.0](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/106)
  - Bump gotestsum to [1.7.0](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/releases/tag/v1.7.0) (adds handy keybindings while you are in `make watch-tests` mode, see [While in watch mode, pressing some keys will perform an action](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum#run-tests-when-a-file-is-saved))
  - Bump watchexec to [1.17.0](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/releases/tag/cli-v1.17.0)
  - Bump golang.org/x/crypto to `v0.0.0-20210711020723-a769d52b0f97`

## 2021-07-29

### Changed

- Fixed `Makefile` has disregarded `pipefail`s in executed targets (e.g. `make sql-spec-migrate` previously returned exit code `0` even if there were migration errors as its output was piped internally). We now set `-cEeuo pipefail` for make's shell args, preventing these issues.

## 2021-06-30

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Switched from [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint) to [`revive`](https://github.com/mgechev/revive)
  - [`golint` is deprecated](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38968).
  - [`revive`](https://github.com/mgechev/revive) is considered to be a drop-in replacement for `golint`, however this change still might lead to breaking changes in your codebase.
- **BREAKING** `make lint` no longer uses `--fast` when calling `golangci-lint`
  - Up until now, `make lint` also ran `golangci-lint` using the `--fast` flag to remain consistent with the linting performed by VSCode automatically.
  - As running only fast linters in both steps meant skipping quite a few validations (only 4/13 enabled linters are actually active), a decision has been made to break consistency between the two lint-steps and perform "full" linting during the build pipeline.
  - This change could potentially bring up additional warnings and thus fail your build until fixed.
- **BREAKING** `gosec` is now also applied to test packages
  - All linters are now applied to every source code file in this project, removing the previous exclusion of `gosec` from test files/packages
  - As `gosec` might (incorrectly) detect some hardcoded credentials in your tests (variable names such as `passwordResetLink` get flagged), this change might require some fixes after merging.
- Extended auth middleware to allow for multiple auth token sources
  - Default token validator uses access token table, maintaining previous behavior without any changes required.
  - Token validator can be changed to e.g. use separate API keys for specific endpoints, allowing for more flexibility if so desired.
- Changed `util.LogFromContext` to always return a valid logger
  - Helper no longer returns a disabled logger if context provided did not have an associated logger set (e.g. by middleware). If you still need to disable the logger for a certain context/function, use `util.DisableLogger(ctx, true)` to force-disable it.
  - Added request ID to context in logger middleware.
- Extended DB query helpers
  - Fixed TSQuery escaping, should now properly handle all type of user input.
  - Implemented helper for JSONB queries (see `ExampleWhereJSON` for implementation details).
  - Added `LeftOuterJoin` helper, similar to already existing `LeftJoin` variants.
  - Managed transactions (via `WithTransaction`) can now have their options configured via `WithConfiguredTransaction`.
  - Added util to combine query mods with `OR` expression.
- Implemented middleware for parsing `Cache-Control` header
  - Allows for cache handling in relevant services, parsed directive is stored in request context.
  - New middleware is enabled by default, can be disabled via env var (`SERVER_ECHO_ENABLE_CACHE_CONTROL_MIDDLEWARE`).
- Added extra misc. helpers
  - Extra helpers for slice handling and generating random strings from a given character set have been included (`util.ContainsAllString`, `util.UniqueString`, `util.GenerateRandomString`).
  - Added util to check whether current execution runs inside a test environment (`util.RunningInTest`).
- Test and snapshot util improvements
  - Added `snapshoter.SaveU` as a shorthand for updating a single test
  - Implemented `GenericArrayPayload` with respective request helpers for array payloads in tests
  - Added VScode launch task for updating all snapshots in a single test file

## 2021-06-29

### Changed

- We now directly bake the `gsdev` cli "bridge" (it actually just runs `go run -tags scripts /app/scripts/main.go "$@"`) into the `development` stage of our `Dockerfile` and create it at `/usr/bin/gsdev` (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
  - `gsdev` was previously symlinked to `/app/bin` from `/app/scripts/gsdev` (within the projects' workspace) and `chmod +x` via the `Makefile` during `init`.
  - However this lead to problems with WSL2 VSCode related development setups (always dirty git workspaces as WSL2 tries to prevent `+x` flags).
  - **BREAKING** encountered at **2021-06-30**: Upgrading your project via `make git-merge-go-starter` if you already have installed our previous `gsdev` approach from **2021-06-22** may require additional steps:
    - It might be necessary to unlink the current `gsdev` symlink residing at `/app/bin/gsdev` before merging up (as this symlinked file will no longer exist)!
    - Do this by issuing `rm -f /app/bin/gsdev` which will remove the symlink which pointed to the previous (now gone bash script) at `/app/scripts/gsdev`.
    - It might also be handy to install the newer variant directly into your container (without requiring a image rebuild). Do this by:
      - `sudo su` to become root in the container,
      - issuing the following command: `printf '#!/bin/bash\nset -Eeo pipefail\ncd /app && go run -tags scripts ./scripts/main.go "$@"' > /usr/bin/gsdev && chmod 755 /usr/bin/gsdev` (in sync with what we do in our `Dockerfile`) and
      - `[CTRL + c]` to return to being the `development` user within your container.

## 2021-06-24

### Changed

- Introduces GitHub Actions docker layer caching via docker buildx. For details see `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`.
- Upgrades:
  - Bump golang from 1.16.4 to [1.16.5](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/RgCMkAEQjSI/m/r_EP-NlKBgAJ)
  - golangci-lint@[v1.41.1](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases/tag/v1.41.1)
  - Bump github.com/rs/zerolog from 1.22.0 to [1.23.0](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/92)
  - Bump github.com/go-openapi/runtime from 0.19.28 to 0.19.29
  - Bump github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/v4 from 4.5.0 to [4.6.0](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v460---2021-06-06)
  - Bump github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate v0.0.0-20210408115534-a32ed26c37ea to v0.0.0-20210614095031-55d5740dbbcc
  - Bump github.com/spf13/viper v1.7.1 to v1.8.0
  - Bump golang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20210513164829-c07d793c2f9a to v0.0.0-20210616213533-5ff15b29337e
  - Bump golang.org/x/sys v0.0.0-20210525143221-35b2ab0089ea to v0.0.0-20210616094352-59db8d763f22
  - Bump google.golang.org/api v0.47.0 to v0.49.0
- Fixes linting within `/scripts/**/*.go`, now activated by default.

## 2021-06-22

### Changed

- Development scripts are no longer called via `go run [script]` but via `gsdev`:
  - The `gsdev` cli is our new entrypoint for development workflow specific scripts, these scripts are not available in the final `app` binary.
  - All previous `go run` scripts have been moved to their respective `/scripts/cmd` cli entrypoint + internal implementation within `/scripts/internal/**`.
  - Please use `gsdev --help` to get an overview of available development specific commands.
  - `gsdev` relys on a tiny helper bash script `scripts/gsdev` which gets symlinked to `/app/bin` on `make init`.
  - Use `make test-scripts` to run tests regarding these internal scripts within `/scripts/**/*_test.go`.
  - We now enforce that all `/scripts/**/*.go` files set the `// +build scripts` build tag. We do this to ensure these files are not directly depended upon from the actual `app` source-code within `/internal`.
- VSCode's `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` now defines that the go tooling must use the `scripts` build tag for its IntelliSense. This is neccessary to still get proper code-completion when modifying resources at `/scripts/**/*.go`. You may need to reattach VSCode and/or run `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`.

### Added

- Scaffolding tool to quickly generate generic CRUD endpoint stubs. Usage: `gsdev scaffold [resource name] [flags]`, also see `gsdev scaffold --help`.

## 2021-05-26

### Changed

- Scans for [CVE-2020-26160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26160) also match for our final `app` binary, however, we do not use `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` as part of our auth logic. This dependency is mostly here because of child dependencies, that yet need to upgrade to `>=v4.0.0`. Therefore, we currently disable this CVE for scans in this project (via `.trivyignore`).
- Upgrades `Dockerfile`: [`watchexec@v1.16.1`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/releases/tag/cli-v1.16.1), [`lichen@v0.1.4`](https://github.com/uw-labs/lichen/releases/tag/v0.1.4) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).

## 2021-05-18

### Changed

- Upgraded `Dockerfile` to `golang:1.16.4`, `gotestsum@v1.6.4`, `golangci-lint@v1.40.1`, `watchexec@v1.16.0` (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Upgraded `go.mod`:
  - [github.com/labstack/echo/v4@v4.3.0](https://github.com/labstack/echo/releases/tag/v4.3.0)
  - [github.com/lib/pq@v1.10.2](https://github.com/lib/pq/releases/tag/v1.10.2)
  - [github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype@v1.3.0](https://github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
  - `github.com/go-openapi/runtime@v0.19.28`
  - [github.com/rs/zerolog@v1.22.0](https://github.com/rs/zerolog/releases/tag/v1.22.0)
  - `github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate@v0.0.0-20210408115534-a32ed26c37ea`
  - `golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210513164829-c07d793c2f9a`
  - `golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20210514084401-e8d321eab015`
  - [google.golang.org/api@v0.46.0](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client/releases/tag/v0.46.0)
- GitHub Actions:
  - Pin to `actions/checkout@v2.3.4`.
  - Remove unnecessary `git checkout HEAD^2` in CodeQL step (Code Scanning recommends analyzing the merge commit for best results).
  - Limit trivy and codeQL actions to `push` against `master` and `pull_request` against `master` to overcome read-only access workflow errors.

## 2021-04-27

### Added

- Adds `test.WithTestDatabaseFromDump*`, `test.WithTestServerFromDump` methods for writing tests based on a database dump file that needs to be imported first:
  - We dynamically setup IntegreSQL pools for all combinations passed through a `test.DatabaseDumpConfig{}` object:
    - `DumpFile string` is required, absolute path to dump file
    - `ApplyMigrations bool` optional, default `false`, automigrate after installing the dump
    - `ApplyTestFixtures bool` optional, default `false`, import fixtures after (migrating) installing the dump
  - `test.ApplyDump(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, db *sql.DB, dumpFile string) error` may be used to apply a dump to an existing database connection.
  - As we have dedicated IntegreSQL pools for each combination, testing performance should be on par with the default IntegreSQL database pool.
- Adds `test.WithTestDatabaseEmpty*` methods for writing tests based on an empty database (also a dedicated IntegreSQL pool).
- Adds context aware `test.WithTest*Context` methods reusing the provided `context.Context` (first arg).
- Adds `make sql-dump` command to easily create a dump of the local `development` database to `/app/dumps/development_YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.sql` (.gitignored).

### Changed

- `test.ApplyMigrations(t *testing.T, db *sql.DB) (countMigrations int, err error)` is now public (e.g. for usage with `test.WithTestDatabaseEmpty*` or `test.WithTestDatabaseFromDump*`)
- `test.ApplyTestFixtures(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, db *sql.DB) (countFixtures int, err error)` is now public (e.g. for usage with `test.WithTestDatabaseEmpty*` or `test.WithTestDatabaseFromDump*`)
- `internal/test/test_database_test.go` and `/app/internal/test/test_server_test.go` were massively refactored to allow for better extensibility later on (non breaking, all method signatures are backward-compatible).

## 2021-04-12

### Added

- Adds echo `NoCache` middleware: Use `middleware.NoCache()` and `middleware.NoCacheWithConfig(Skipper)` to explicitly force browsers to never cache calls to these handlers/groups.

### Changed

- `/swagger.yml` and `/-/*` now explicity set no-cache headers by default, forcing browsers to re-execute calls each and every time.
- Upgrade [watchexec@v1.15.0](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/releases/tag/1.15.0) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).

## 2021-04-08

### Added

- Live-Reload for our swagger-ui is now available out of the box:
  - [allaboutapps/browser-sync](https://hub.docker.com/r/allaboutapps/browser-sync) acts as proxy at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/).
  - Requires `./docker-helper.sh --up`.
  - Best used in combination with `make watch-swagger` (still refreshes `make all` or `make swagger` of course).

### Changed

- Upgrades to [swaggerapi/swagger-ui:v3.46.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/v3.46.0) from [swaggerapi/swagger-ui:v3.28.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/compare/v3.28.0...v3.46.0)
- Upgrades to [github.com/labstack/echo@v4.2.2](https://github.com/labstack/echo/releases/tag/v4.2.2)
- `golang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20210322153248-0c34fe9e7dc2`
- Upgrades to [google.golang.org/api@v0.44.0](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client/releases/tag/v0.44.0)

## 2021-04-07

### Changed

- Moved `/api/main.yml` to `/api/config/main.yml` to overcome path resolve issues (`../definitions`) with the VSCode [42crunch.vscode-openapi](https://github.com/42Crunch/vscode-openapi) extension (auto-included in our devContainer) and our go-swagger concat behaviour.
- Updated [api/README.md](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/blob/master/api/README.md) information about `/api/swagger.yml` generation logic and changed `make swagger-concat` accordingly

## 2021-04-02

### Changed

- Bump [golang from v1.16.2 to v1.16.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.16.3+label%3ACherryPickApproved) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).

## 2021-04-01

### Changed

- Bump golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210322153248-0c34fe9e7dc2
- Bump golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20210331175145-43e1dd70ce54
- Bump [github.com/go-openapi/swag@v0.19.15](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/71)
- Bump [github.com/go-openapi/strfmt@v0.20.1](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/70)

## 2021-03-30

### Changed

- Bump [github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum@v1.6.3](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/releases/tag/v1.6.3) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).

## 2021-03-26

### Changed

- Bump [golangci-lint@v1.39.0](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases/tag/v1.39.0) (requires `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).

## 2021-03-25

### Changed

- Bump github.com/rs/zerolog from [1.20.0 to 1.21.0](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/69)
- Bump google.golang.org/api from [0.42.0 to 0.43.0](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/pull/68)

## 2021-03-24

### Changed

- We no longer do explicit calls to `t.Parallel()` in our go-starter tests (except autogenerated code). For the reasons why see [FAQ: Should I use `t.Parallel()` in my tests?](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/FAQ#should-i-use-tparallel-in-my-tests).
- Switched to [github.com/uw-labs/lichen](https://github.com/uw-labs/lichen) for getting license information of embedded dependencies in our final `./bin/app` binary.
- The following make targets are no longer flagged as `(opt)` and thus move into the main `make help` target (use `make help-all` to see all targets):
  - `make lint`: Runs golangci-lint and make check-\*.
  - `make go-test-print-slowest`: Print slowest running tests (must be done after running tests).
  - `make get-licenses`: Prints licenses of embedded modules in the compiled bin/app.
  - `make get-embedded-modules`: Prints embedded modules in the compiled bin/app.
  - `make clean`: Cleans ./tmp and ./api/tmp folder.
  - `make get-module-name`: Prints current go module-name (pipeable).
- `make check-gen-dirs` now ignores `.DS_Store` within `/internal/models/**/*` and `/internal/types/**/*` and echo an errors detailing what happened.
- Upgrade to [`github.com/go-openapi/runtime@v0.19.27`](https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/compare/v0.19.26...v0.19.27)

## 2021-03-16

### Changed

- `make all` no longer executes `make info` as part of its targets chain.
  - It's very common to use `make all` multiple times per day during development and thats fine! However, the output of `make info` is typically ignored by our engineers (if they explicitly want this information, they use `make info`). So `make all` was just too spammy in it's previous form.
  - `make info` does network calls and typically takes around 5sec to execute. This slowdown is not acceptable when running `make all`, especially if the information it provides isn't used anyways.
  - Thus: Just trigger `make info` manually if you need the information of the `[spec DB]` structure, current `[handlers]` and `[go.mod]` information. Furthermore you may also visit `tmp/.info-db`, `tmp/.info-handlers` and `tmp/.info-go` after triggering `make info` as we store this information there after a run.

## 2021-03-15

### Changed

- Upgrades `go.mod`:
  - [`github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/v4@v4.5.0`](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v450---2021-03-14)
  - [`github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal@v1.8.0`](https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
  - `golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210314154223-e6e6c4f2bb5b`
  - ~`golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20210314195730-07df6a141424`~
  - `golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20210315160823-c6e025ad8005`
  - [`google.golang.org/api@v0.42.0`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client/releases/tag/v0.42.0)
- `make help` no longer reports `(opt)` flagged targets, use `make help-all` instead.
- `make tools` now executes `go install {}` in parallel
- `make info` now fetches information in parallel
- Seeding: Switch to `db|dbUtil.WithTransaction` instead of manually managing the db transaction. _Note_: We will enforce using `WithTransaction` instead of manually managing the life-cycle of db transactions through a custom linter in an upcoming change. It's way safer and manually managing db transactions only makes sense in very very special cases (where you will be able to opt-out via linter excludes). Also see [What's `WithTransaction`, shouldn't I use `db.BeginTx`, `db.Commit`, and `db.Rollback`?](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/FAQ#whats-withtransaction-shouldnt-i-use-dbbegintx-dbcommit-and-dbrollback).

### Fixed

- The correct implementation of `(util|scripts).GetProjectRootDir() string` now gets automatically selected based on the `scripts` build tag.
  - We currently have 2 different `GetProjectRootDir()` implementations and each one is useful on its own:
    - `util.GetProjectRootDir()` gets used while `app` or `go test` runs and resolves in the following way: use `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` (if set), else default to the resolved path to the executable unless we can't resolve that, then **panic**!
    - `scripts.GetProjectRootDir()` gets used while **generation time** (`make go-generate`) and resolves in the following way: use `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` (if set), otherwise default to `/app` (baked, as we can assume we are in the `development` container).
  - `/internal/util/(get_project_root_dir.go|get_project_root_dir_scripts.go)` is now introduced to automatically switch to the proper implementation based on the `// +build !scripts` or `// +build scripts` build tag, thus it's now consistent to import `util.GetProjectRootDir()`, especially while handler generation time (`make go-generate`).

## 2021-03-12

### Changed

- Upgrades to `golang@v1.16.2` (use `./docker-helper.sh --rebuild`).
- Silence resolve of `GO_MODULE_NAME` if `go` was not found in path (typically host env related).

## 2021-03-11

### Added

- `make build` (`make go-build`) now sets `internal/config.ModuleName`, `internal/config.Commit` and `internal/config.BuildDate` via `-ldflags`.
  - `/-/version` (mgmt key auth) endpoint is now available, prints the same as `app -v`.
  - `app -v` is now available and prints out buildDate and commit. Sample:

```bash
app -v
allaboutapps.dev/aw/go-starter @ 19c4cdd0da151df432cd5ab33c35c8987b594cac (2021-03-11T15:42:27+00:00)
```

### Changed
