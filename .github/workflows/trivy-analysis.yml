    # Currently limited to master because of the following:
    # Workflows triggered by Dependabot on the "push" event run with read-only access. Uploading Code Scanning results requires write access.
    # To use Code Scanning with Dependabot, please ensure you are using the "pull_request" event for this workflow and avoid triggering on the "push" event for Dependabot branches.
    # See https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/configuring-code-scanning#scanning-on-push for more information on how to configure these events.
